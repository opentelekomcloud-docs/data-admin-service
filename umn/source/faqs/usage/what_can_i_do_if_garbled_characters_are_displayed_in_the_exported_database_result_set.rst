What Can I Do If Garbled Characters Are Displayed in the Exported Database Result Set?
======================================================================================

CSV files exported from DAS are encoded in UTF-8, whereas Excel files are encoded in ANSI. Encoding inconsistency resulted in garbled characters.

You are advised to open the CSV file using a text editor and save the file in ANSI encoding.
