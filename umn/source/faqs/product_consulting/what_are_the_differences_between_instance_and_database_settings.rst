What Are the Differences Between Instance and Database Settings?
================================================================

The following can be configured for both instances and databases:

-  DBA and owner
-  Security control items (single query of rows returned in the SQL window and whether DDL and DML operations can be executed in the SQL window)
-  Approval process customization

Settings of these items for an instance will be synchronized to the database when the database is synchronized to the system for the first time. However, later modifications on the instance would not affect this database again.
