Advantages
==========

DAS supports different types of DB instances, such as GaussDB(for openGauss), GaussDB(for MySQL), and GaussDB(for Cassandra). It provides visual GUI operations, making your database management easy and efficient.

Anytime, Anywhere
-----------------

A DAS web console frees you from installing clients locally and supports access anytime, anywhere.

Kernel Source Code Optimization
-------------------------------

The kernel is optimized and enhanced to support functions such as emergent database O&M and SQL explorer, to resolve O&M pain points.

Secure Operations
-----------------

Built-in security mechanisms guarantee stability of your databases so you can worry less about security and stay focused on operations. For example, if a user executes a slow SQL statement, DAS automatically uses a timeout mechanism to protect databases against jitter caused by long execution time.

Robust Features
---------------

With DAS, a wide range of features are available for you to choose from, such as binlog-based data tracking and rollback, SQL statement diagnosis, scheduled SQL task execution, up to 10 GB SQL file import and export, and cross-instance database table structure synchronization. DAS, currently, supports only GaussDB(for openGauss) databases.
