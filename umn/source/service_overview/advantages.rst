Advantages
==========

Anytime, Anywhere
-----------------

The DAS web console means there is no need to install clients locally and you can access your databases anytime, from anywhere.

Secure Operations
-----------------

Built-in security systems protect your databases so you can worry less about security and stay focused on operations. For example, when you execute a slow SQL statement, DAS automatically triggers a timeout mechanism to protect databases from jitter.

Robust Features
---------------

DAS provides a wide range of features, such as scheduled SQL execution, import and export of up to 1 GB of data, and table structure synchronization across instances.
