Creating a Schema
=================

After a database is created, you need to create a schema because database operations cannot be performed in system schemas. Create a new schema and execute SQL statements.

Procedure
---------

#. In the login list, click **Login** of the desired GaussDB(for openGauss) DB instance to log in to the instance.
#. In the database list of the **Home** page, locate the target database and click **Manage** in the **Operation** column.
#. Click **Create Schema**. On the displayed page, enter a schema name.
#. Click **OK**. The schema you create appears in the schema list.
